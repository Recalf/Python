Hi,
These are my projects, you can see the extent of my abilities in them,
also as you'll see in the first one (my latest project "JobsHuntingScrape" py script right now) is that i used a module, in which i've spent a lot of time to create, i can solve captcha v2 or v1 without using any subscription like 2captcha with it +
other basic measures to not get detected as a bot when using the scraper

So, the first file is a dynamic web scraper that selects dynamic filters and click on links to scrape jobs details (adresses + contact info including email, which they were in a bit of a messy state to scrape) and put them in organized csv files
The second one is a basic bot that plays cookie clicker game with the ability to buy upgrades...
The third one is a project that goes to a bicycles site and scrapes the geometry and sizes tables and puts them into a csv
