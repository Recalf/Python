Hi,
The first file "JobsHuntingScrape" is a dynamic web scraper that selects dynamic filters and clicks on links to scrape each job details from a specific job site (adresses + contact info including email, they were in a bit of a messy state to scrape) and puts them in organized csv files
The second one "CookiesGame" is a basic bot that plays cookie clicker game with the ability to buy upgrades...
The third one "VeloPandaTables" is a scraper that goes to a specific bicycles site and scrapes the geometry + sizes tables of each bike and puts them in organized format in a csv
