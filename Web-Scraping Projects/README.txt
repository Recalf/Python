Hi,
These are my projects,
in the "JobsHuntingScrape" script, you'll see that i've used a module i named 'Captcha', its a module that i've spent quite a lot of time to create, with it, i can solve captcha v2 or v1 without using any subscription like 2captcha + I did some basic measures in that module to not easily get detected as a bot while using the scraper

So, the first file "JobsHuntingScrape" is a dynamic web scraper that selects dynamic filters and clicks on links to scrape each job details from a specific job site (adresses + contact info including email, they were in a bit of a messy state to scrape) and puts them in organized csv files
The second one "CookiesGame" is a basic bot that plays cookie clicker game with the ability to buy upgrades...
The third one "VeloPandaTables" is a scraper that goes to a specific bicycles site and scrapes the geometry + sizes tables of each bike and puts them in organized format in a csv
