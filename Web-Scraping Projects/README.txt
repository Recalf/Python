Hi,
These are my projects,
in the "JobsHuntingScrape" script, you'll see that i used a module named Captcha, its a module that i've spent quite a lot of time to finish, with it, i can solve captcha v2 or v1 without using any subscription like 2captcha  + i made some basic measures to not get detected as a bot while using the scraper

So, the first file "JobsHuntingScrape" is a dynamic web scraper that selects dynamic filters and clicks on links to scrape jobs details (adresses + contact info including email, which they were in a bit of a messy state to scrape) and puts them in organized csv files
The second one "CookiesGame" is a basic bot that plays cookie clicker game with the ability to buy upgrades...
The third one "VeloPandaTables" is a project that goes to a bicycles site and scrapes the geometry + sizes tables and puts them in organized format in a csv
